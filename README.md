I graduated from a Chinese university with a bachelor's degree and worked in a Chinese software company for a year and a half.
Now i'am in Japan,I'am learning Japanese and looking for a job in Japan.

I like to read all kinds of books, I read more than 100 books every year，
the topics of the books are about education, learning, business, psychology, physics, computers, etc.

I do research on some of my own topics on athletic training and second language acquisition.

On github I would like to be able to document my learning and create some of my own programs.

Welcome everyone to work with me on some interesting projects.
